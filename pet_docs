## Owner Information

Email: noah.clark@gmail.com
Home Address: 1428 Maple Avenue, Apt 3B, Los Angeles, CA 90024

## About My Cat
Name: Mittens
Age: 3 years
Breed: Maine Coon mix
Distinguishing features: White paws (hence the name), orange and brown tabby markings, very fluffy tail

## Feeding Schedule
Mittens is primarily fed twice daily:
- Morning (7-9 AM): 1/3 cup of Royal Canin Indoor Adult dry food
- Evening (5-7 PM): 1/3 cup of dry food + 1/2 small can of Fancy Feast wet food (salmon or chicken flavor only)

Please ensure fresh water is always available in both her ceramic bowl in the kitchen and the stainless steel one in the bathroom.

## Medication
None currently required. Mittens is healthy and up-to-date on all vaccinations.

## Treats
Mittens can have up to 5 Greenies dental treats per day, preferably after her evening meal. She will try to convince you she deserves more - don't fall for it! My cat is quite the manipulator when it comes to treats.

## Playtime
Mittens needs at least 15-20 minutes of interactive play daily. Her favorite toys are:
- The red feather wand (stored in the living room cabinet)
- The catnip mouse (usually under the couch)
- The crinkle ball (in her toy basket by the TV)

She particularly enjoys "hunting" games where you drag toys along the floor for her to chase.

## Litter Box
Located in the bathroom closet. Please scoop daily and add fresh litter as needed. Fresh litter and scooper are stored in the cabinet above the washing machine.

## Sleeping Spots
Mittens has several favorite spots:
1. The window perch in the living room (her daytime sunbathing spot)
2. The blue cat bed in my bedroom
3. On top of the couch cushions
4. And sometimes, if you're sitting down, she'll claim your lap

## Personality Notes
- Mittens is generally very friendly but can be shy with new people initially
- She dislikes loud noises (vacuum, blender)
- My cat loves chin scratches but doesn't like her paws touched
- She's quite vocal in the morning when she wants breakfast
- If she brings you a toy, it means she wants to play
- She may hide under the bed during thunderstorms - this is normal

## Special Instructions
- Please text me a photo of Mittens once daily so I know she's doing well
- Mittens is strictly an indoor cat - do NOT let her outside under any circumstances
- If she seems unusually lethargic or refuses food for more than 12 hours, please contact me immediately

## MONTHLY NEIGHBORHOOD NEWSLETTER - JUNE 2023

### COMMUNITY CATS CORNER

**Feline Friends of Oakridge**

Welcome to our newest column dedicated to our community's beloved feline residents! Each month, we'll be featuring neighborhood cats, sharing helpful pet care tips, and creating opportunities for our cat-loving neighbors to connect.

**Featured Feline: Mr. Whiskers**

The handsome gray tabby you may have spotted lounging in the front window on Maple Street belongs to our neighbor Noah Clark. Mr. Whiskers, a 3-year-old domestic shorthair, has become something of a local celebrity with his playful antics and friendly demeanor.

"He's incredibly social for a cat," says Noah. "He actually waits by the window to greet joggers and dog-walkers in the morning."

Noah adopted Mr. Whiskers from the Oakridge Animal Shelter two years ago and says it was the best decision he's ever made. "Having a cat has completely changed my home life for the better. There's nothing like coming home to a purring friend after a long day."

**Summer Safety Tips for Cat Owners**

As temperatures rise, remember these important guidelines:
‚Ä¢ Ensure fresh water is always available
‚Ä¢ Create shaded areas if your cat enjoys outdoor time
‚Ä¢ Watch for signs of overheating (excessive panting, lethargy)
‚Ä¢ Consider trimming long-haired cats for comfort
‚Ä¢ Keep windows screened to prevent falls

**Cat Playdate Network Launching!**

Do you have a social cat like Mr. Whiskers? Noah Clark is organizing monthly "Cat & Coffee" gatherings for neighborhood cat owners to connect while their feline friends socialize in a safe environment. The first meetup will be held in Noah's cat-proofed backyard on June 25th at 10am. RSVP to noahc@oakmail.com or call 555-0128.

**Neighborhood Cat Census**

We're creating a directory of Oakridge's feline population! Send a photo and brief bio of your cat to community@oakridgeobserver.com for inclusion in next month's issue. Already, we've learned that our neighborhood is home to at least 37 cats, ranging from kittens to seniors over 15 years old!

**Lost & Found**

Have you seen Mochi? This cream-colored Persian cat went missing from the Wilson residence on Oak Drive last Tuesday. She's microchipped and wearing a purple collar. Contact Sarah Wilson at 555-8742 with any information.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Healthy adult male DSH cat
2. Good dental healing following last month's cleaning
3. Appropriate weight - slight increase since last visit is within normal range

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue dental home care as previously discussed with Mr. Clark - daily brushing using the cat-specific toothpaste
2. Maintain current premium dry food diet (Indoor Cat Formula)

NOTES:
Mr. Clark has been diligent with Whiskers' dental home care following last month's cleaning. He reports his cat has adapted well to the tooth brushing routine when performed in the evening. We discussed the importance of continuing this practice to maintain dental health between professional cleanings. Noah mentioned his cat has been more playful since the dental procedure, suggesting he may have had some discomfort previously.
