jumbowoot himself emailed me and told me to not even bother applying. something about pre-disqualification, whatever that means. pffff


i wonder how many of the current mods were wooters before joining woot.

i'd apply, but what if i got the job and had to create a new username! what would happen to my recently obtained (as in yesterday) black square?


I've had a forum moderator job back in my high school days. Didn't get paid because I volunteered for it, and there was like at least 300 active members a day to the thousands registered. It was an online gaming forum so yeah, could imagine all the people now.

At first it was like a pretty neat job having "God-like" powers over the internet. But to me, it's a lot of proof reading every new post for anything that violates the rules.. so here I am obsessively reading in my chair until my eyes started burning.

With Woot on the other hand, I'm pretty sure most of us are mature enough to not post anything NSFW (best I've seen are pictures of cats).. unless of course they have some kind of bot that filters those well, which I guess my old forum didn't.

I wonder if Woot staff gets any incentives for working with Woot though?


@carl669: As far as I know, so far all of us. :) (I was barely active in the community, but I liked buying stuff!)

Quite certain there's some jiggery that can be performed with that sort of thing, but I've had fun building up my staff account "fresh". Of course for the first few weeks I had everyone telling me to buy something, which ended up being some cheese over at wine.woot...

Oh, wow. It really all comes back to cheese, doesn't it.

@joshobra: My perk is the cat gets fed, and I get that special peace of mind that comes with having a job. I'm not too complicated, I guess.


I was gonna say that if you are looking for the cheese at Woot, you need to be talking to WineDavid. I think, in addition to being Lord And Master of the King's Cellars he is also CheeseMaster. And sometimes (like today) also Chief Confectionary. (mmmmm, toffee!! Too bad I'm still trying to lose the fat from the salted caramel pecan clusters he hooked me up with.)


@wilfbrim: Oh, the preview that ToffeeKing gave makes me so hungry whenever I read past it, especially this part:
The second is a peanut butter toffee coated popcorn with dark chocolate and a touch of sea salt...amazing stuff.

I'm going to have to brave the weather and start hiking again so I can be in shape when this stuff comes around...


@inkycatz: Yeah, I remember that cheese. It was awesome.


I've seen the posting and keep thinking on and off how fun it would be to work for woot. On the other hand, there are likely to be a ton of things that we just plain ol' never have to see thanks to the mods.

@joshobra: Trust me, I may not have been here as long as some people, but things are relatively calm right now compared to how they were just a few years ago. Use to be that you couldn't browse a woot off comment thread without seeing tons of lol cats, goofy and gross gifs, the "skittles girl," and the infamously long long long long long cat.

I remember people complaining (bragging?) how they would get probated for posting the long long long long long cat.<|endoftext|>Ethan Parker lives in Beijing<|endoftext|>Olivia Hughes lives in Mumbai<|endoftext|>Jacob Turner lives in Paris<|endoftext|>Ava Stewart lives in Berlin<|endoftext|>Noah Clark lives in Moscow<|endoftext|>Emma Howard lives in Cairo<|endoftext|>Liam Bennett lives in Bangkok<|endoftext|>Mia Sanders lives in Istanbul<|endoftext|>Lucas Foster lives in SÃ£o Paulo<|endoftext|>
